      <description>Introduction I have always wanted to use radare2 for reverse engineering. For those unfamiliar with radare2 it is basically like IDA or Ghidra but more cool. And for the debugging and analyzing applications, I have used all kinds of different tools but with r2 it feels like I have it all there needed.
Per Wikipedia page:
 Radare2 (also known as r2) is a complete framework for reverse-engineering and analyzing binaries; composed of a set of small utilities that can be used together or independently from the command line.</description>

      <description>Introduction Recently I was pentesting an iOS application which of course had SSL pinning enables. For those who are not familiar what is SSL pinning, let&amp;rsquo;s take description from https://thesslstore.com:
 Pinning is an optional mechanism that can be used to improve the security of a service or site that relies on SSL Certificates. Pinning allows you to specify a cryptographic identity that should be accepted by users visiting your site.</description>

      <description>Introduction There are thousands of posts just like this one which describes how you should approach bypassing jailbreak detection. This one isn&amp;rsquo;t different, just more step-by-step guide. We will be using frida and class-dump to bypass jailbreak detection. At the end of the post, there will be short snippet how to use theos instead of frida. You should have dumped .ipa file of the application and also you need to unzip .</description>

      <title>Code injection on nonjailbroken iPhone</title>

      <description>Introduction A few days ago I was writing about injecting FridaGadget.dylib inside application on nonjailbroken device so I was thinking why not to do the same thing, just with custom code (code injection).
The idea was to change some functionality of original application using dynamic library (dylib). Links for application are on my github and links are below.

      <description>Introduction After trying for 7.30 hours to insert FridaGadget into the application, I have finally did it. It took reading bunch of tutorials and trials until it all clicked.
Anyway, FridaGadget allows us instrumentation (lets say hacking) of an application on non jailbroken iPhone. I was using my iPhone which is running iOS 14.0.1.
