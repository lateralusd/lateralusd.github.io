      <description>Introduction I was thinking about showing you guys how similar iOS and Mac OS applications are. What is the better way than cracking the software on Mac OS. I would not disclose the name of the application and images will be blurred because I do not want to get in trouble lol.
Originally, I was using Hopper to patch the binary, but I guess not everyone wants to pay for the things so we will be using r2.</description>

      <description>Introduction A few days ago I was writing about injecting FridaGadget.dylib inside application on nonjailbroken device so I was thinking why not to do the same thing, just with custom code (code injection).
The idea was to change some functionality of original application using dynamic library (dylib). Links for application are on my github and links are below.
