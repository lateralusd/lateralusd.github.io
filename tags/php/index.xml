      <description>Introduction I know this is not about MacOS nor iOS but this was something that had to be written.
Recently I had a web application penetration test on which I have found CSV injection and a great example of bypassing PHP image upload. Users with admin privileges had an option to change user&amp;rsquo;s profile picture which immediately caught my eye.
App details  Fictional hostname: example.com Language: PHP Framework: Laravel  Analysis After messing around with trying to upload some php shell I was constantly getting 500 Internal Server Error which was kinda a clue to me that application is not allowing anything besides good ol&#39; images.</description>
