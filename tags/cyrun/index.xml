      <description>We have all been playing with cycript and changing those labels or perhaps we hid some views but we did not see the bigger picture of all of it, and the biggest question of them all is how it is related to class-dump and theos. To make things clear, im gonna take local news app.
Theos Lets take definition from iphonedevwiki which says:
 Theos is a cross-platform suite of development tools for managing, developing, and deploying iOS software without the use of Xcode.</description>
